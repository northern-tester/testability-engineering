# Principles of Testability Engineering

## Mission

Engineering for testability intends to create a culture of co-development for all who contribute to a product, working to reduce toil and tension caused by difficult to test systems.

### Each layer of your architecture must have feedback loops

We believe that a focus on improving testability gives the team meaningful feedback at a cadence appropriate to their work. Risk accumulates as feedback slows, testability not only increases the cadence and speed, but also the quality of that feedback.

### Testable systems create the conditions for collaboration

We will work towards a highly testable system which is the most effective route to enabling whole team testing cultures. Easier to test systems encourage empathy, skill transfer and shared responsibility of testing by removing the perception of testing as a bottleneck.

### Architectures designed for simplicity improve team flow

We believe that the testability of our application architecture is a leading indicator of quality. Designing our architectures for testability, with early and often consideration for testing increases flow of value and reduces toil.
  
### Testable systems open and expand organisational relationships

We believe that the quality of our relationships within our organisation increase testability by profound understanding of risk and reward. Knowing what is valued by the team and those connected to it targets our testability to the best return on investment.

### Proactive instrumentation exposes information that matters

We understand that a testable system enables deep investigation of the risks that we identify and unanticipated problems that may occur. Testing is skilled exploration for information about threats to value, instrumenting our application code  to increase observability enhances that exploration. Observability tools and techniques are the lens to visualise and filter that information.

### Testing is most effective when state can be controlled

We understand that when your system state is not controllable the side effects of testing cannot be observed, which compromise the effectiveness of your testing. For testing to give the most relevant and timely information, controllability is required.

### Good operability practices are synonymous with testability

We believe that a highly testable system is more operable for our contributors and customers, reducing their toil and frustration. The practices of operability lead to testability gains, removing many of the obstacles to effective testing.

### Enhancing adjacent testability improves the wider system

We will work to understand and improve the testability of our dependencies, so as to increase our own testability. We recognise that if one of our dependencies has poor testability, own own testability will be constrained.
