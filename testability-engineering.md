# Principles of Testability Engineering

## Mission

Engineering for testability intends to create a culture of co-development for all who contribute to products, working to reduce toil and tension caused by difficult to test systems.

### Enhancing testability leads to a virtuous cycle of collaboration

We will work towards a highly testable system which is the most effective route to enabling whole team testing cultures. Easier to test systems encourage empathy, skill sharing and dependence on individuals.

### Enhancing adjacent testability improves the wider system

We will work to understand and improve the testability of our dependencies, so as to increase our own testability. We recognise that if one of our dependencies has poor testability, own own testability will be constrained.

### Architectures designed for testability improve flow

We believe that the testability of our application architecture is a leading indicator of quality. Designing our architectures for testability, with early and often consideration for testing increases flow of value and reduces toil.

### Striving for simplicity enhances testability through common understanding

We understand that testable systems strive for simplicity and benefit all through creating common understanding. Complexity excludes contribution, therefore our understanding of risks and the needs of all involved.
  
### Better organisational relationships increase testability

We believe that the quality of our relationships within our organisation increase testability by profound understanding of risk and reward. Thoughtful team structures and 

### Observability enables deep investigation of risk

We understand that a testable system enables deep investigation of the risks that we identify and unknowable problems that may occur. Testing is skilled exploration for information about threats to value, observability tools and techniques are the lens to view and filter that information.

### Control of your system is proportional to effectiveness of your testing

We understand that when your system state is not controllable the side effects of each test cannot be observed, which compromise the effectiveness of your testing. For testing to give the most relevant and timely information, controllability is required.

### Applying good operability principles is synonymous with testability

We believe that a highly testable system is more operable for our contributors and customers, reducing their toil and frustration. The principles of operability lead to testability gains, removing many of the obstacles to effective testing.
